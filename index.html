    <span id="output">I just wanted to drop you a quick note because, well, you've been on my mind a lot lately. Like, more than Santa's on people's rooftops. 
This Christmas, I wanted to tell you that you're the gift, Your energy, your vibe â€“ it's like unwrapping the coolest present under the tree. And let me tell you, I'm hoping for many more "present" moments with you in the coming year. So here's to a Christmas filled with laughter, joy, and maybe a touch of mistletoe magic. Wishing you all the best and sweetness this season has to offer.</br></br> If you were a star, you'd be the one lighting up my night. And trust me</br> the night sky would be envious</br> of the way you shine.
